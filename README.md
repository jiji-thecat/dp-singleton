# Design Pattern - Singleton pattern

## Description

![singleton](https://github.com/jiji-thecat/dp-singleton/assets/104809324/419866cc-6248-459c-bf29-80fb15a957b9)

The Singleton pattern is a design pattern used to ensure that only one instance of a class can be created.

### Class Diagram

[wiki](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_%E3%83%91%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3)

There are three key points from this diagram:

1. The class instance is declared as a private class variable.
2. The constructor is declared as private.
3. The `getInstance()` method is declared to return the class instance created in step #1.

## How to Use This App

This app attempts to generate an instance of the Earth class multiple times by pressing a button. However, since the Singleton pattern is used, it will only generate one instance. To prove this, the memory address of the instance is displayed, and it remains the same for all attempts.
